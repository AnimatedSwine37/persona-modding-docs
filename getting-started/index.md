This guide assumes that you have already installed [Reloaded-II](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II) and setup mods for the game you want to mod. If you haven't yet, please do so and then come back here (guides for [P3P](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/15677), [P4G](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/15696), [P5R](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/15399)).

{: .todo }
Add a dedicated page on setting up mods.

This is split up into a number of sections, if this is your first time making mods it is recommended to go through them in order.
