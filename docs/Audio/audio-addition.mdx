## Introduction

Music addition (new songs not replacing any existing songs) is possible for the PC releases of P3P, P4G, and P5R using the [BGME Framework](https://gamebanana.com/mods/477399). To add new music, this mod must be downloaded and set as a dependency for your mod.

## Adding New Music

There are two main ways to add new music in Persona games.

- [Phos Music Manager](https://github.com/T-PoseRatkechi/phos-music-manager/releases) is a music manager designed to simplify music replacement or addition in Persona 3 Portable (PC), Persona 4 Golden (PC x64), and Persona 5 Royal (PC). It automatically handles all steps needed to encode and export music.
- If you would rather manually add new music files, [AtomEncd](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jx9NBu40XUcJb0U4MdsVjPV84UTzWcpy/view) should be used instead.

## Adding New Music Files

:::info
More detailed documentation on the Phos Music Manager can be found [here](https://t-poseratkechi.github.io/PersonaMusicScript/guides/music-manager).
:::

To add new music files to your project, click on the + icon next to the Build button.

A popup will open where you can enter details about the new song you are adding.
- Name: the name of the track
- Category (optional): the category shown in caps (ex: Regular Battles, Events, etc.). This is purely for organizational purposes.
- Tags (optional): any tags to more clearly detail what the track is for (ex: Normal, Results Screen, etc.). This is purely for organizational purposes.
- Output Path: the file path of the exported file.
- Encoder: the encoder that should be used for the exported file.

The output path and encoder depend on the game being modded.

### Output Path
The output path should be set to `FEmulator/AWB/snd00_bgm.awb/songID.hca`, where `songID.hca` is the ID of the new track you are adding. Use IDs ranging from 678 up to 835 for new music.

:::info
If you want your mod to be compatible with existing BGME music mods, make sure to check what IDs those mods are using. [Music Enhancement Pack](https://gamebanana.com/sounds/49693) uses IDs 679-692, [Anime Music Expansion](https://gamebanana.com/mods/475152) uses IDs 775-821, and [Restored Game Over Music](https://gamebanana.com/sounds/71006) uses ID 774.

## Using New Music

New music can be used right away in [events](../Events/events.mdx) and [flowscript](../Flowscripts/flowscript.mdx) by calling their IDs. To change battle music using BGME, follow [the guide here](./battle-music.mdx).
