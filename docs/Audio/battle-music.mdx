title: Battle Music Editing

## Introduction

Changing battle music beyond what is provided in the stock games is possible for the PC releases of P3P, P4G, and P5R using the [BGME Framework](https://gamebanana.com/mods/477399). To allow for advanced BGM changing, this mod must be downloaded and set as a dependency for your mod.

BGME provides a convenient scripting language that can be used to add new battle music or change how existing battle music is called, etc. To use this, create a new folder in your mod directory called `BGME`. In this folder, create a new text file called `(script name).pme`, where `(script name)` can be replaced with a name of your choice. This can be done in the same file used for [custom event music](../Events/BGME-events.mdx) if desired.

:::info
When the game is booted, a `(script name).project` file is generated. This can be loaded into Phos Music Manager. More information can be found [here](https://t-poseratkechi.github.io/PersonaMusicScript/guides/music-manager).

## BGME documentation

[The BGME Framework has its own, detailed documentation that can be found here](https://t-poseratkechi.github.io/PersonaMusicScript). It is highly recommended to use this documentation to learn how to use BGME's features. This page will include a few examples of what BGME is capable of.

## Examples of BGME's features

### Randomized Battle Music (Normal Battles)

Random battle music can be set using `random_song(minID, maxID)`, which will play randomized music in a range between (and including) `minID` and `maxID`.

```
encounter["Normal Battles"]:
  music = random_song(minID, maxID)
end
```

### Changing Music for Specific Encounters

Unique music for specific encounters can be set by setting the desired music ID to play for that battle.

```
encounter[encounterID]
  music = songID
end
```

A list of premade BGME IDs referred to as *collections* can be found [here](https://t-poseratkechi.github.io/PersonaMusicScript/docs/collections). Encounter IDs can be found on the Amicitia wiki for [Persona 3 Portable](https://amicitia.miraheze.org/wiki/Persona_3_Portable/Encounters), [Persona 4 Golden](https://amicitia.miraheze.org/wiki/Persona_4_Golden/Encounters), and [Persona 5 Royal](https://amicitia.miraheze.org/wiki/Persona_5_Royal/Encounters).

### Setting Normal, Advantage, and Disadvantage Battle Music

BGME can set unique music for normal battles, player advantage battles, and enemy advantage battles. This functionality is already seen in stock Persona 4 Golden (Reach Out To The Truth for player advantage, Time To Make History for normal/enemy advantage) and Persona 5 Royal (Take Over for player advantage, Last Surprise for normal/enemy advantage), but BGME expands on it.

```
encounter["Normal Battles"]:
	music = battle_bgm(normalID, advantageID, disadvantageID)
end
```

`normalID` plays the chosen song ID for a normal battle, `advantageID` plays the chosen song ID for a player advantage battle, and `disadvantageID` plays the chosen song ID for an enemy advantage battle.

Alternatively, these calls can be used individually:
```
encounter["Normal Battles"]:
	victory_music = songID_1
	normal_bgm = songID_2
	victory_normal_bgm = songID_3
	advantage_bgm = songID_4
	victory_advantage_bgm = songID_5
	disadvantage_bgm = songID_6
	victory_disadvantage_bgm = songID_7
end
```

## Editing ENCOUNT.TBL

:::warning
For most cases, BGME should be used instead. Ignore this unless you know what you're doing!
:::

If you want to manually edit battle music calls without using BGME, you can edit `ENCOUNT.TBL`. for Persona 3 FES, Persona 4, Persona 3 Portable, and Persona 4 Golden is stored in `init_free.bin/battle/ENCOUNT.TBL`. Editing this file requires the use of [010 Editor](https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/) and [several templates](https://github.com/tge-was-taken/010-Editor-Templates) designed for file types supported by the Persona games. Extract these templates to a separate folder.

Extract `ENCOUNT.TBL` using Amicitia or Persona Editor, then open it in 010 Editor. By running a template on it, we can use a more readable format. Open a template by clicking the Run Template button, then the Open Template button, or press `Ctrl + F5`.

![](/assets/images/events/010_template.png)

Open your 010 templates folder and select the correct template. For example, P4G's TBL template is located in `/templates/p4g_tbl.bt`. This will run the template on the file you have open and present it in a more readable format as shown below.

Expanding the drop downs shows the following data:
- Enemy Encounters\[x\]: x represents the encounter ID. A list of encounter IDs can be found on [Amicitia wiki](https://amicitia.miraheze.org/wiki/Persona_4_Golden/Encounters).
- Music: the selected battle music.
- u16 Field04: Set to 1 to enable BGME, so that different music plays in a given encounter.

The default selection of battle BGM is shown below.
