Events have varying levels of documentation depending on their format. There are three different formats used in the modern Persona games.

- Persona 3 FES, Persona 4, Persona 4 Golden: .PM1, .PM2, .PM3 files
	- .PM1 files have text
	- .PM2 files have the event scripting, message calls, ambience calls, etc. These are not well understood at this time.
	- .PM3 files have BGM and SFX calls.
- Persona 3 Portable: .bf files
	- These can be decompiled into .msg files (text) and .flow files (flowscript). Further documentation on flowscript can be found [here](../flowscript/flowscript.mdx).
- Persona 5 Royal: .EVT files
